<span class="indent">Warm-up</span> activity: The teacher plays a short clip where there are two ways of refusing to an invitation. Having watched the clip, the teacher asks the questions below from the students and explains the speech act thoroughly. The questions are as follows: 
•	What are the differences between two ways of refusing?
•	Who are the interlocutors? 
•	How would refuse to a request, invitation, offer or suggestion? 
•	Do you think that people refuse equally all over the world or there is a difference from culture to culture? What may be those differences? 
•	Have you ever got any refusal?
Then, the teacher slowly moves to the next part of the class.
